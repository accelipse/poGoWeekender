# poGoWeekender
An app that notifies me of the current raid boss, counters, and bonuses each weekend.

Generates a text-based email, newsletter graphic, and interfaces with Google home.
Can support pushes to multiple users.
Users can set status to playing or not-playing, to give people ideas for raid availability.
